Snake
The project focuses on the artificial intelligence of the Snake game. The snake's goal is to eat the food continuously and fill the map with its bodies as soon as possible. Originally, the project was written in C++. It has now been rewritten in Python for a user-friendly GUI and the simplicity in algorithm implementations.
